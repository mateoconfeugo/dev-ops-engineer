                    <ul>
                      <li>Single page web apps using a mix of client/server solutions deployed via web browsers using web 2.0 methods. These have been implemented using jQuery, Underscore.js, Require.js, Backbone.js and a client side templating library Jemplate.  The most recent application is a tool for creating various types of online advertisements.</li>
                      <li>Created an real time distributed budget server to throttle requests for ad listings  across a large number of advertisement delivery servers using Clojure to build a Storm topology that is running on the JVM.</li>
                      <li>Myself and two other colleagues at ValueClick were given the responsibility of running a profitable ad network system (Search123).  Vastly understaffed and facing a decaying unfamiliar code base - we set about improving things while keeping the business going and clients happy.  Regular scheduled realistic releases and integrated and automated systems were key.  We re-factored the system into manageable components.  These initiatives have led to a  straight forward development environment where focus is on  implementing new features that internal business clients, publishers and advertisers use to make better decisions,resulting in more revenue. </li>

                    <div class="work_experience">
Architected, Designed and Created a SaaS application that facilitates landing site optimizing  for incoming traffic.  The system  is composed of several servers using the Clojure language and a javascript HTML5 CSS3 management web application written in Clojurescript that compiles down into javascript.   Real Time optimization data is processed and generated via Storm and feed to the delivery engine.  I Created a provisioning system using the dev ops library Palletops to create the necessary infrastructure in the Rackspace/Amazon Cloud.  The web application includes a drag and drop site builder application so that user can easily create responsive HTML5/CSS3 web pages.  The front end web client was built using Clojurescript taking advantage of the core.async libraries.  The management application communicates with a server transparently ,written in Clojure, using the compojure/enlive framework removing the false complexity of AJAX/REST type client server interaction.   This management application runs on the Heroku platform hosted on the Amazon cloud.

       	<div class="work_experience">
Working as an independent contractor built an automated gardening system that is monitored and administered remotely. I designed, built and tested both the hardware and the software.  The hardware is controlled by a Samsung S3C2440A system on a chip running an arm debian distro.  The micro server provides access to the various hardware controlled by it via a single page web app that adjusts for screen, tablet and mobile devices.  This web app is built using the following: jQuery, underscore.js, backbone.js, require.js, bootstrap, Jemplate, socket.io.js.   The web app is powered by a JSON REST server built using the Perl Catalyst framework and some C++.  The environment is controlled by a task server that allows the gardner to schedule tasks as well as have task run when certain conditions in the system occur.</li>
